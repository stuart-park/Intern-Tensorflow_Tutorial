Following tutorial guides on tensorflow in jupyter notebook and modular programming via vscode

## Description
+ Tutorial.ipynb: Code in image classification for tutorial. Used tf.data instead of from_directory. 
+ Tutorial file: Modulizing jupyter code into it's function. Create class by it's function and initialize it. Also I created a parser for yaml file to easily manipulate some hyper parameters in model. Also I tried 3 kind of model traning. One is using 'fit()' API in keras. The other two is using customized fit, each is made with a class and a function. There was no big difference in training time, but 'fit()' API was more easy to use.
